# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13

## Overview
We are creating maps to show USGS Earthquake data, around the world.  This data was captured in the last 7 days.  Data can be represented on a Street view or Satellite map.  Additionally, you can select from various layers which show Tectonic Plates, All Earthquake data, or just Large Earthquake data (over magnitude 4.5).

## Results
### Deliverable 1:  Add Tectonic Plate Data
Maps are created to show Tectonic Plate Data, lines are shown in red with a weight of 3.  We are able to select from the 2 map tile layers:
- Streets
- Satellite

Additionally we are able to view 2 overlay options:
- Earthquakes (all earthquakes in last 7 days)
- Tectonic Plates

INSERT:  Del 1 image

### Deliverable 2: Add major Earthquake Data
We modified the maps to also include an overlay for:
- Major Earthquakes - earthquakes over magnitude 4.5

The earthquake data is represented by circles that are:
- Red - greater then 6.0
- Orange - greater then 5.0
- Green - greater then 4.5

INSERT:  Del 2 image

### Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
We modified the maps to include 1 additional tile layer:
- Dark

INSERT: Del 3 image

## Summary
- Deliverables 1,2 and 3 were completed
- Date was committed and pushed to GitHub in the Earthquake_Challenge branch.
- The Earthquake_Challenge branch was merged into the main branch
